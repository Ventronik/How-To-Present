## What
1. What you present will always be up to you.
2.

## Where
1. Meetups are your friends
Larger monthly meetups typically exist for the sake of attendees learning new things. Either advancing knowledge in what they already do, or learn capabilities of something they were not aware.
* SeattleJS
* PuPPy
* ReactJS
* SeaJure
* And many more!!!! (No really if you peruse meetup.com you could literally never pay for dinner again)
2. Twitch is... a thing
3. Medium.com the home for the prolific but shy
4. Youtube, not just for Eastern Europeans

## When

## How
1. Public Speaking Basics
2. Technology tools
* Powerpoint, Slides.com, Adobe Spark
* Unsplash.com
* MarvellApp
3.

## Why

## Presenting with Slides
1. Do Not clutter the slide, 6 bullet points is enough
2. Provide note material for people either blank paper, or MORE detailed information than what is on the Slides
3. Transitions add next to no benefit
4. Don't think too much about colors.
  * If you pick a color stick with it
  * Normally Black or White text is fine, If you are over a multicolor image use white font with a black border
